BUILDING AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
======================================

On *nix, from the tarball:

	$ ./configure && make && sudo make install

	Pire uses GNU autotools, so all customizations of the build process
	(overriding compiler or its flags, installation into other directory,
	cross-compiling, etc...) is applicable for Pire as well.
	`./configure --help' gives you a brief description of those.

	If you want additional features placed in extra/ directory (CountingScanner,
	CapturingScanner and GlueSimilarGlyphs feature), add `--enable-extra' option
	to ./configure.

	You will find stubs for package specs in pkg/ directories. You can use them for providing
	a package for your favourite distribution; your contribution will be highly appreciated.


On *nix, from VCS:

	You will need GNU autotools (autoconf, automake and libtool), bison and flex.

	Once you have all this, simply run
	$ autoreconf --install && ./configure && make all check && sudo make install

	To rebuild the tarball, run `make distcheck'.


On Windows:

	Unpack the tarball and run `nmake -f pkg\Makefile.win32 all'.

	If you want to build bleeding edge version from VCS, you'll need to install bison, flex
	and create a project on your own.
